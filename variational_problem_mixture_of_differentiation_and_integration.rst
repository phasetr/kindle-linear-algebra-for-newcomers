Variational problem: mixture of differentiation and integration
===============================================================

Examples of variational problems
================================

shortest time problem
---------------------

Assume you are a lifesaver on beach and there is a person drowning. You
have to save the person. How do you determine a path to the person in
the shortest possible time? This is a famous variational problem.

You have to determine a path and it is a function mathematically. Hence
you have to search a function in a function space. How to search it?

A similar physical problem is discussed in high school: optics,
refraction. In society this is related to how to design optical fibers
to reduce light-loss.

Mathematical formulatrion: functionals, linear operators
========================================================

We formulate the above problem mathematically. In usual we make a some
**functional** and search a function which optimize, i.e., minimize or
maximize the value of it. In this procedure we differentiate a
functional by functions, and this is a variational derivatice.

Recall an energy functional (:eq:`linear-algebra-and-calculus-4`). This
energy functional is a mixed type functional of differential and
integral. We often face this type of functionals in theory of partial
differential equations, in particular, quantum mechanics and we need a
minimum value of :math:`E` and its minimizer. These are physically
important quantities, ground state energy and ground state. Some types
of quantum mechanical problems are formulated as a variational problem.
