Introduction
============

This note is based on a course for newcomers in the spring of 2014 at
the Tokyo institute of Technology. See also the `free math textbook <https://github.com/phasetr/math-textbook>`_.

We talk about linear algebra, especially itâ€™s relation to calculus,
i.e., differentiation and integration.

In this talk we speak in Japanese but write in English on blackboard. It
is because I want newcomers to get used to writing and reading in
English.
