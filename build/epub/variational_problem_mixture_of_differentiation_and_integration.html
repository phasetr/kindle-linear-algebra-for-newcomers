<h3>shortest time problem</h3>
<p>Assume you are a lifesaver on beach and there is a person drowning. You
have to save the person. How do you determine a path to the person in
the shortest possible time? This is a famous variational problem.</p>
<p>You have to determine a path and it is a function mathematically. Hence
you have to search a function in a function space. How to search it?</p>
<p>A similar physical problem is discussed in high school: optics,
refraction. In society this is related to how to design optical fibers
to reduce light-loss.</p>

<h2>Mathematical formulatrion: functionals, linear operators</h2>
<p>We formulate the above problem mathematically. In usual we make a some
<strong>functional</strong> and search a function which optimize, i.e., minimize or
maximize the value of it. In this procedure we differentiate a
functional by functions, and this is a variational derivatice.</p>
<p>Recall an energy functional (<a href="#equation-linear-algebra-and-calculus-4">(?)</a>). This
energy functional is a mixed type functional of differential and
integral. We often face this type of functionals in theory of partial
differential equations, in particular, quantum mechanics and we need a
minimum value of <img class="math" src="_images/math/fa2fa899f0afb05d6837885523503a2d4df434f9.png" alt="E"/> and its minimizer. These are physically
important quantities, ground state energy and ground state. Some types
of quantum mechanical problems are formulated as a variational problem.</p>
